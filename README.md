# HTR_CRNN_CTC
CNN-BiLSTM with CTC implementation for HTR

Implementation of a CNN-BiLSTM architecture with CTC loss for the task of Handwritten Text Recognition. The idea and architecture is based on [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717.pdf) paper while the implementation is based on [this](https://theailearner.com/2019/05/29/creating-a-crnn-model-to-recognize-text-in-an-image-part-1/) blog. The dataset used is the IAM handwritten text data.  The training, validation and testing partition is based on the Aachen partition as mentioned in [this](https://github.com/omni-us/research-seq2seq-HTR) github repo.
